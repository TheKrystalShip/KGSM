# üì° KGSM Event System

KGSM features a robust event broadcasting system that operates through Unix Domain Sockets. This system allows external applications (like [KGSM-Bot](https://github.com/TheKrystalShip/KGSM-Bot)) to monitor and respond to various game server lifecycle events in real-time. The event system provides a clean, decoupled mechanism for extending KGSM's functionality without modifying its core.

## üîå How It Works

Events are JSON-formatted messages broadcast through a Unix Domain Socket when specific actions occur within KGSM, such as starting a server instance, creating a backup, or updating a game server. External applications can listen to these events and react accordingly.

### Prerequisites

To enable and use the event system:

1. Set `enable_event_broadcasting=1` in your KGSM configuration file
2. Install the `socat` utility, which is required for Unix socket communication
3. Ensure external applications have read/write access to the socket file location

## üîÑ Event Structure

Each event is transmitted as a JSON object with the following format:

```json
{
    "EventType": "<event_name>",
    "Data": { 
        "InstanceName": "<instance_name>",
        ...other event-specific data
    }
}
```

- `EventType`: A string identifying the event type (e.g., `instance_started`)
- `Data`: An object containing event-specific information, always including at least the `InstanceName`

### Example Event

```json
{
    "EventType": "instance_started",
    "Data": {
        "InstanceName": "minecraft_survival",
        "Blueprint": "minecraft"
    }
}
```

## üìù Available Events

KGSM broadcasts events for the full lifecycle of game server instances. Events are categorized based on their purpose:

### üõ†Ô∏è Instance Creation Events

|------------|-------------|----------------|
| `instance_update_started` | Server update initiated | - |
| `instance_update_finished` | Server update completed | - |

|------------|-------------|----------------|
| `instance_started` | Server started | - |
| `instance_stopped` | Server stopped | - |
| `instance_backup_created` | Backup created | Source, Version |
| `instance_backup_restored` | Backup restored | Source, Version |

### üóëÔ∏è Removal Events

| Event Name | Description | Additional Data |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| `instance_uninstall_started` | Uninstallation process initiated | - |
| `instance_files_removed` | Server files removed | - |
| `instance_directories_removed` | Server directories removed | - |
| `instance_removed` | Instance removed | - |
| `instance_uninstall_finished` | Uninstallation process completed | - |
| `instance_uninstalled` | Server fully uninstalled | - |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Socket File Location

Events are broadcast to the socket file located at:

```
$KGSM_ROOT/$event_socket_filename
```

By default, this resolves to: `$KGSM_ROOT/kgsm.sock`

### How Events Are Emitted

KGSM uses helper functions prefixed with `__emit_` to broadcast events through the socket. The core function that handles event broadcasting is `__emit_event`:

```bash
__emit_event <event_name> <event_data_json>
```

Each event type has its own specific emission function that constructs the appropriate JSON payload and passes it to `__emit_event`.

## üß© Integration Guide

### Listening for Events

To listen for KGSM events in your application, you can use tools like `socat` or implement a Unix Domain Socket listener in your preferred programming language. Here's a simple example with `socat`:

```bash
socat UNIX-LISTEN:/path/to/kgsm.sock,fork -
```

For more reliable integration, you should implement:

1. **Connection handling** - Reconnect if the socket is recreated
2. **Event filtering** - Process only events relevant to your application
3. **Error handling** - Gracefully handle cases where the socket is unavailable

### Sample Client Code (Python)

```python
import socket
import json
import os

SOCKET_PATH = "/path/to/kgsm.sock"

def listen_for_events():
    if os.path.exists(SOCKET_PATH):
        os.unlink(SOCKET_PATH)
    
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.bind(SOCKET_PATH)
    sock.listen(1)
    
    print(f"Listening on {SOCKET_PATH}")
    
    while True:
        connection, client_address = sock.accept()
        try:
            data = connection.recv(1024)
            if data:
                event = json.loads(data.decode('utf-8'))
                print(f"Received event: {event['EventType']}")
                # Process the event based on its type
                process_event(event)
        finally:
            connection.close()

def process_event(event):
    event_type = event['EventType']
    instance_name = event['Data']['InstanceName']
    
    if event_type == 'instance_started':
        print(f"Server {instance_name} has started!")
    elif event_type == 'instance_stopped':
        print(f"Server {instance_name} has stopped!")
    # Handle other event types as needed
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

To enable the event system, edit your KGSM configuration file:

1. Set `enable_event_broadcasting=1` to enable event broadcasting
2. Optionally customize `event_socket_filename` to change the socket file name (default: `kgsm.sock`)

## üîç Debugging

If events aren't being broadcast:

1. Verify `enable_event_broadcasting=1` in your configuration
2. Check that `socat` is installed
3. Ensure the socket file exists and has proper permissions
4. Monitor socket activity with: `socat UNIX-CONNECT:/path/to/kgsm.sock -`

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Reconnection Logic** - Implement robust reconnection handling in client applications
2. **Selective Handling** - Process only events relevant to your application's functionality
3. **Event Validation** - Always validate event data before processing
4. **Atomic Actions** - Keep event handlers atomic; don't create complex dependencies between them
5. **Logging** - Maintain logs of received events for troubleshooting

By leveraging KGSM's event system, you can extend the functionality of your game server management with custom notifications, automated actions, monitoring systems, and more, all without modifying the core KGSM codebase.
