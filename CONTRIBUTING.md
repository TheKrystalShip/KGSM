## Key Areas for Contribution

### Game Server Blueprints
The most valuable contribution is adding support for new game servers:
- **Native Blueprints**: Add `.bp` files for games with native Linux server support
- **Container Blueprints**: With KGSM 2.0, you can contribute `docker-compose.yml` files for containerized game servers
- Use the existing blueprints in the `blueprints/default` directory as templates
- Follow the guidelines in `docs/blueprints.md`

### System Compatibility
- Test KGSM on different Linux distributions and report compatibility
- Add support for alternative system components:
  - Process management systems (alternatives to systemd)
  - Firewall configurations (alternatives to ufw)
  - Enhanced event data and monitoring capabilities

### Testing and Bug Reports
- Test KGSM on your Linux distribution and report any compatibility issues
- Report bugs using the issue templates on GitHub
- Verify fixes and new features work across different environments

### Documentation
- Improve guides, tutorials, and examples
- Translate documentation to other languages
- Add diagrams or screenshots to clarify complex concepts

## Using GitHub Issue Templates
The project includes several issue templates for different types of contributions:
- Bug Report
- Feature Request
- New Game Server
- Documentation Improvement

Please use these templates when creating new issues as they help provide the necessary information.

## Coding Standards
KGSM uses an `.editorconfig` file to maintain consistent coding styles across different editors. Please ensure your editor respects the following settings:
- Indent style: Spaces
- Indent size: 2
- End of line: LF
- Charset: UTF-8
- Trim trailing whitespace: True

- Adhere to constructs supported by `shellcheck` where possible.

## Reporting Issues and Requesting Features
When submitting an issue, please include:
- The KGSM version you’re using.
- Your operating system and versions of Bash and systemd (if applicable).
- Steps to reproduce the issue.

For suggesting new game server support, use the **New Game Server** issue template, ensuring:

- Relevant details like Steam App ID or official download links are provided.

## Testing Contributions
KGSM now has a testing framework in the `tests/` directory. Contributors are encouraged to:
- Add tests for new features or bug fixes
- Run the existing test suite before submitting PRs: `./tests/run.sh`
- Manually verify their changes with various configurations
- Test on multiple Linux distributions if possible
