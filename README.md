## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions to KGSM are always welcome! Here are some ways you can help:

### Game Server Blueprints

The most valuable contributions are new game server blueprints. If you've successfully set up a game server that isn't currently supported by KGSM, consider sharing your work:

1. Create a new blueprint file in `blueprints/custom/native/` or `blueprints/custom/container/` either from an existing blueprint or from the template file: `templates/blueprint.tp`
2. Test it thoroughly to ensure it works properly by running the full installation, lifecycle (start/stop/restart etc), uninstall
3. Submit a pull request to have it included in the main project

### Other Contributions

- Report bugs and suggest features through [GitHub Issues][5]
- Improve documentation
- Add support for more distribution-specific integration options
- Share your success stories and use cases
